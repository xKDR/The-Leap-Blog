## What constitutes a good article for this blog?

1. **What is the question?** Who cares about this question? Is this an interesting and important question? Is there a clearly posed question and a clear answer, on a question that matters in the world today?

2. **Is it new?** What is common knowledge to the (specialised) readership of this blog is not good enough. It's got to say something new.

3. **Is it a logically sound argument?** Mere assertions do not suffice. Linearity of argument, where facts and arguments are brought together to win an argument, are critical.

4. **Does it stand a fair chance at persuading a skeptical reader who previously thought otherwise?** We do not write for the applause of those who already agree with us; we write in the hope of persuading people who do not agree with us.

## Mechanics of Submission

Please send your submissions to [theleapjournal@gmail.com](mailto:theleapjournal@gmail.com).

All charts and graphics should follow [these guidelines](http://www.mayin.org/ajayshah/MISC/charts-etiquette.html).

### HTML Syntax Checking

We recommend using [tidy](http://tidy.sourceforge.net/) to validate your HTML.

## Typesetting Mathematics

You can include LaTeX-style mathematics in your articles. For example:

```
$$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$$
```

Renders as: $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$

## Typesetting Blocks of Computer Code

Use code blocks with syntax highlighting:

```r
# Make the NPV of an annuity p
value.of.pension <- function(p, S, r, l=0) {
    (1/r)^(1:l) %*% (p * S)
}
```

## Doing References Well

When citing sources:
- Use descriptive link text (not "click here")
- Link to primary sources when possible
- Include the full title of referenced documents
