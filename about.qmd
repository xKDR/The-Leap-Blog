The Leap Blog explores the intersection of law, economics, and policy, with a focus on India's development challenges and institutional reforms.

We examine how legal systems, economic incentives, and policy frameworks shape outcomes, and explore pathways to better governance and development.

Our writing covers topics ranging from court reforms and banking regulation to technology policy, state capacity, and public finance.
